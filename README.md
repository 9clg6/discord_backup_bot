This bot enables anyone to make backups of their Discord server(s) at configurable frequencies. It can also import these backups to rebuild the servers.
Backup are encrypted with hybrid encryption (RSA/AES). 

## ðŸ’» Installation

###  Supabase

1. To deploy this bot, you need to set up a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database.
2. Create two collections named : 
	2.1. "**initialization**"
	
	It allows you to save the status of your servers, whether they are initialized or not.
	The fields to be set are :
	
			- serverId: int8 (primaryKey)
			- isInitialized: bool
			- isInitialized: int8
			- param: int8
   			- channelId: int8
   			- publicKey: text
   			
			
	2.2. "**save**"

	This collection will directly store exports from your Discord servers. Channels (voice and text) and messages will be compressed and stored as strings.
The fields to be set are :
	
			- id: int8
			- server: text
			- serverName: text
			- serverId: int8
			- encryptedAes: text
   			- iv: text
			
4. Retrieve your API Key on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
5. Create a `.env` file containing the Discord API Key, the Supabase token and the URL of the Supabase database. An `.example.env` file has already been versioned
6. **OPTIONAL**: Ideally, you should set up a Docker, hosted on your own server or in a cloud, like OVH for example.

## ðŸ’¡ How to use 

Once you've set up the environment, all you have to do is type `/initialize` in a text channel and your backup will be scheduled every day at the time you sent the command.
You have to provide your public key for the encryption.

# Discord backup bot with Hybrid Encryption

This bot enables anyone to make backups of their Discord server(s) at configurable frequencies. It can also import these backups to rebuild the servers.
Backup are encrypted with hybrid encryption (RSA/AES). 

## üíª Installation

###  Supabase

1. To deploy this bot, you need to set up a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database.
2. Create two collections named :
   
	2.1. "**initialization**"
	
	It allows you to save the status of your servers, whether they are initialized or not.
	The fields to be set are :
	
			- serverId: int8 (primaryKey)
			- isInitialized: bool
			- isInitialized: int8
			- param: int8
   			- channelId: int8
   			- publicKey: text
   			
			
	2.2. "**save**"

	This collection will directly store exports from your Discord servers. Channels (voice and text) and messages will be compressed and stored as strings.
The fields to be set are :
	
			- id: int8
			- server: text
			- serverName: text
			- serverId: int8
			- encryptedAes: text
   			- iv: text
			
4. Retrieve your API Key on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
5. Create a `.env` file containing the Discord API Key, the Supabase token and the URL of the Supabase database. An `.example.env` file has already been versioned
6. **OPTIONAL**: Ideally, you should set up a Docker, hosted on your own server or in a cloud, like OVH for example.

## üí° How to use 

### Initilization / Export

Once you've set up the environment, all you have to do is type `/initialize [publicKey]` in a text channel and your backup will be scheduled every day at the time you sent the command.
You have to provide your public key for the encryption, in **512 bits PKCS8**.

Or you can also export your server, without scheduling a regular repeat, by typing the command `/export [publicKey]`.

### Import


To import your backup, simply call the command `/import [serverId] [privateKey]` where `[serverId]` is the identifier of the server you wish to restore (it can be found by enabling developer mode in your Discord settings) and `[privateKey]` is the private key (associated with the public key you provided to export or initialize the bot).

# **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è After each import, you must change the RSA key pair to secure the data. Each pair can only be used once, otherwise your new data may be exposed. ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**

## üòÄ Support

I will gladly accept your MRs :) 
In particular for key parsing, cleaning and management of other PKCS standards
